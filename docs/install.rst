Installation
============

Most end users should use ``pip`` to install this package:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m pip install stdlib-list


If for whatever reason you need to install ``stdlib-list`` from the
source repository instead:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/pypi/stdlib-list
    cd stdlib-list
    python -m pip install .
